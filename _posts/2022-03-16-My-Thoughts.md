### Entry 1: Jan 15

Recently, my therapist has suggested that I start something to document my thoughts so here it is. A collection of my deepest and darkest thoughts that I have been dealing with my whole life. I'm not even sure if this will help, nothing so far has and it only seems to be getting worse... 

### Entry 2: Feb 3

I've been having these weird thoughts lately. Like is any of this real? Or not? 

I used to have such a good idea of how my life would go, I used to have big asperations. Now everything that I do is an attempt to suppress the darkness. It is omnipresent in my life, ever since the accident. I can't even tell if the thoughts I am having are actually me anymore, my mind has been corrupted by it, I am starting to lose control over it and soon I fear I will not be able to fight it any longer.

### Entry 3:  Feb 28

Orbital Weapons seems to be going well. Chet, Saul, Dudley, and I are making immense amounts of progress and soon our vision for the future will be completed. A world where mass destruction by way of a satellite is merely a few clicks away. Once again I wonder, do the others know? Do they know that its not always me talking or my ideas? I highly doubt is because they are simply not smart enough to notice it, they haven't seen darkness like I have. With progress on the Desolator going well I am starting to think of my exit strategy. To preserve the last little bit of actual humanity I have left I must find a way to stop this thing that I have created. I have been able to keep it from surfacing for a bit now, but I'm not sure if it is listening right now. If it is then my plan is known, then there is no way to stop the world from certain destruction. If it wins then nothing will be able to stop it. Dylantran might be humanities last hope...

### Entry 4: March 16

It's done. Its over. It is getting more aggressive and starting to take over everything, my thoughts and even my movements. I am afraid that Riki will soon be no more. The Purple Goblin might be the last thing left of me. This might be my last time speaking as Riki. DT you are our only hope. Do what needs to be done.
