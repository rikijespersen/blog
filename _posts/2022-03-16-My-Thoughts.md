### Entry 1: Jan 15

Recently, my therapist has suggested that I start something to document my thoughts so here it is. A collection of my deepest and darkest thoughts that I have been dealing with my whole life. I am optimistic that this may help. I really hope it helps me retain control because nothing so far has and it only seems to be getting worse... 

### Entry 2: Jan 24

I've been having these weird thoughts lately. Sudden flashes of instrusive ideas. Yet, when I try to recall them, I remember nothing. I wonder if any of this real? Or not? 

I used to have such a good idea of how my life would go, I used to have big asperations. At Harvard I was confident, outgoing, and hopeful for my future. But for some strange reason, I find it hard to maintain that personality. Now everything that I do is an attempt to suppress this darkness eating away at me. It is omnipresent in my life, ever since that accident. I don't even know what happened, but I do know that people started looking at me with a hint of fear in their eyes ever since. 
I can't even tell if the thoughts I am having are actually me anymore or if my mind has already been corrupted by it. I feel as though I am starting to lose control over my own thoughts and I fear the worst.

### Entry 3: Feb 2

I've started to be able to remember more. Those sudden flashes unconciousness don't occur as often anymore. It seems as though following my therapist's suggestions and practicing meditations has helped me stay aware. But that's something I realized that I actually fear.
Even though I am starting to retain conciousness, I find that no matter how hard I try, I am still unable to regain control of my actions. The other day, I cut in line at the supermarket while ranting about how high California taxes were. I couldn't do anything to stop myself! I had to watch as customers gave me some nasty looks and scorn me silently. It was so embarassing! But 10 times worse was the feeling of helplessness.

I even started to notice a sharp increase in my temper. I've snapped at Jory multiple times this week for not advertising our Desolator cannon well enough. I hope he forgives me, I have not been myself recently.

### Entry 4:  Feb 6

Orbital Weapons seems to be doing well. Chet, Saul, Jory, Dudley, and I are making immense amounts of progress and soon our vision for the future will be completed. A world where mass destruction by way of a satellite is merely a few clicks away. Sometimes I wonder, do the others recognize the internal struggles that I am facing? Do they know that its not always me talking or presenting my ideas? I highly doubt it is because they are simply not smart enough to notice it; they just haven't seen darkness like I have. With progress on the Desolator going well I am starting to think of my exit strategy. To preserve the last little bit of actual humanity I have left I must find a way to stop this thing that I have become. I have been able to keep it from surfacing for a bit now, but I'm not sure if it is listening right now. If it is then my plan is known, then there is no way to stop the world from certain destruction. If it wins then nothing will be able to stop it. As much as I love Orbital Weapons, I think it would be best for me to leave the company before I hurt anyone else.

### Entry 5: Feb 13

The worst has happened. Dudley is gone. For some reason they promoted me to his position. I am now the CEO of Orbital Weapons, but it didn't have to happen like this! No one knows the truth about Dudley's dissappearance. No one except me, and the other me. I don't know how I can live with myself knowing what truly happened. The worst part is, I will be forced to watch as the other me begins to take control of Orbital Weapons. I can already feel the last amounts of control I have seeping out of my body. Please know, I never meant for this to happen.

### Entry 6: February 14

Hey everyone! What's up! It's your girl, Riki! Looking back at my past posts, I used to be such a drama queen hahaha! I mean, can you imagine anyone being upset about Dudley "mysteriously disappearing?" That old man had it coming if you ask me. Did you know that he would always give away 50% of his income to charity? What an idiot! Everyone knows that you're only supposed to care about yourself and no one else. If I were him, I would devote all of that money to developing the Desolator cannon so I can finally achieve my dreams of world domination! That's a joke of course, I wouldn't need the Desolator cannon to bend the world at my whims :)

### Entry 7: March 3

I never realized how boring it was to keep up appearances! Sometimes I wish I can just let all of my frustrations out on my coworkers. I don't know why Chet decided he needed a vacation or why Saul stopped talking to me as much. I hope they're not noticing that the pathetic previous Riki is out of the picture. Regardless, it wouldn't hurt to play into the whole, "Oh noo, I'm losing control of myself" moody vibe that the past Riki had. I need to lay low for my plans to come to fruition. So I decided to make a Discord support group for myself! That and some convincing Twitter posts might just be enough for me to maintain some "normalcy." HA I love manipulating people, it's always so much fun!
If there's someone actually reading this dumb diary, feel free to join my Discord! https://discord.gg/BwcGg3Xs7J. I doubt you can stop me even if you tried.
